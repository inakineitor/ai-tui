# Plan: Add Linting to GitHub CI/CD

## Summary
Create a new GitHub Actions workflow that runs linting checks on pull requests to enforce code quality before merging.

## Changes

### 1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Create a new workflow file with the following configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup pnpm 10
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 10

      - name: Setup Node.js 24.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 24.x

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pnpm i

      - name: Run Linting
        run: pnpm dlx ultracite check
```

### Why This Approach

1. **Separate workflow file** - Keeps linting separate from release logic for clarity
2. **Mirrors local setup** - Uses same Node.js (24.x) and pnpm (10) versions as the release workflow
3. **Check mode** - Uses `ultracite check` to validate without modifying files (appropriate for CI)
4. **PR trigger** - Runs on pull requests to catch issues before merge

## Files Modified

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Create (new file) |

## Verification

After implementation:
1. Create a test branch with a linting issue (e.g., unused import)
2. Open a PR to main
3. Verify the CI workflow runs and fails on the linting issue
4. Fix the issue and verify the workflow passes
