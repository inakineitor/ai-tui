# Plan: Enable GitHub Releases from Changesets

## Summary

Add automatic GitHub release creation when packages are published via changesets.

## Current State

The release workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml` uses `changesets/action@v1` to:
1. Create "Version Packages" PRs when changesets exist
2. Publish packages to npm when the version PR is merged

**GitHub releases are NOT currently created.**

## Solution

Add the `createGithubReleases: true` option to the changesets action configuration. This is a single-line change.

## Files to Modify

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Current:**
```yaml
- name: Create Release Pull Request or Publish to npm
  id: changesets
  uses: changesets/action@v1
  with:
    publish: pnpm release
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Create Release Pull Request or Publish to npm
  id: changesets
  uses: changesets/action@v1
  with:
    publish: pnpm release
    createGithubReleases: true
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

## Behavior After Change

When packages are published (after merging a "Version Packages" PR):
- Packages are published to npm (existing behavior)
- A GitHub release is automatically created for each published package
- The release will include the changelog content from the changeset

## Verification

1. Merge this change to `main`
2. Create a changeset: `pnpm changeset`
3. Commit and push to `main`
4. Wait for the "Version Packages" PR to be created
5. Merge the "Version Packages" PR
6. Verify that:
   - Packages are published to npm
   - GitHub releases appear in the repository's Releases page
