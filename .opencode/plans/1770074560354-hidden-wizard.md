# Plan: Remove redundant outDir from tsdown.config.ts

## Summary

Remove the redundant `outDir: "dist"` option from `packages/core/tsdown.config.ts` since `dist` is the default value in tsdown.

## Evidence

From tsdown documentation:
> "The default output is './dist', but can be changed with the '-d' or '--out-dir' flags."

## Change

**File:** `packages/core/tsdown.config.ts`

Remove line 8: `outDir: "dist",`

## Verification

1. Run `pnpm build` (or the build command for the core package) to ensure the output still goes to `dist/`
2. Run `pnpm dlx ultracite check` to verify no linting issues
