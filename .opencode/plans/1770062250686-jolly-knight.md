# Plan: Clean up tsconfig package.json

## Summary
The `@ai-tui/tsconfig` package already has `"private": true`, which prevents npm from publishing it. The `publishConfig` block is redundant and can be removed for clarity.

## File to Modify
- `packages/tsconfig/package.json`

## Change
Remove the redundant `publishConfig` section:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "name": "@ai-tui/tsconfig",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "license": "MIT",
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name": "@ai-tui/tsconfig",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

## Note
The package **cannot** be added to changeset's `ignore` list because `@ai-tui/components` and `@ai-tui/core` depend on it. However, since `private: true` is set, it will never be published to npm regardless of changeset operations.

## Verification
No verification needed - the package is already correctly configured to not be published.
